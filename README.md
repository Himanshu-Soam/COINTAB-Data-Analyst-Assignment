Problem Statement: 

We have two sets of data, one is from company X and another one from the Courier company. The company X is a ecommerce company and X gets a thousands of orders via their website on a daily basis and they have to deliver them as fast as they can. For delivering the goods ordered by the customers, X has tied up with multiple courier companies in India as delivery partners who charge them some amount per delivery. So, the company X has to pay to the courier companies, they want to verify if the
charges levied by their Delivery partners per Order are correct.

Please refer to the attached documents and datasets for more information.
